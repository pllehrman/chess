    - Only allow two connections to the web socket. Generate a particular hash code
      once a user starts a game (API call) which then only allows one other user
      to join.
    - If a third party attempts to join display "The Game is Full"
- Stockfish integration
    - Play against the computer should be easier than 1v1 playing
