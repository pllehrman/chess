Unit Tests: These tests focus on individual components or functions in isolation, ensuring that each part of the 
application behaves as expected. Unit tests are the foundation of a solid test suite and help catch bugs early 
in the development process.

Integration Tests: These tests focus on the interactions between different components or systems. They ensure that 
various parts of the application work together as expected. For example, testing the interaction between your controllers 
and models, or testing the integration with external services or APIs.

End-to-End (E2E) Tests: These tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. They are performed in an 
environment that closely resembles the production environment. E2E tests are crucial for testing the entire application's 
flow and ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.

Performance Tests: These tests assess the application's performance under various conditions, such as high traffic or 
data load. They help identify bottlenecks and ensure that the application can handle expected loads.

Security Tests: These tests focus on identifying vulnerabilities in the application, such as injection attacks, 
cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security threats. Security testing is essential for maintaining the integrity 
and safety of your application and its users.

User Acceptance Tests (UAT): These tests are usually conducted by the end-users or clients to validate that the 
application meets their requirements and expectations. UAT is crucial for ensuring that the application is ready 
for production and will satisfy the users' needs.
